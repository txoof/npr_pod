Podcastify many NPR programs easily. 

run the script with the -C option to create a configuration file:
$ ./podcastdownload.py -C 

The configuration file will be created in ~/.podcastdownload.ini 

See the configuration file for more help in setting up and adding additional shows.

If you decide to use this script to scrape NPR program audio from the NPR web pages
please consider donating to your local NPR affiliate. The bandwidth is not free and 
producing great content (clearly you enjoy it or you wouldn't be scraping it) costs 
money as well.
